# Problema 1: *Easy*
## Sum
You are given three integers `a`, `b` and `c`.
Determine if one of them is the sum of the other two.

### Input
The first line contains a single integer `t` `(1 <= t <= 9261)` - the number
of test cases.
The description of each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, `c` `(0
<= a,b,c <= 20)`

### Output
For each test case, output "`YES`" if one of the numbers is the sum of the other
two, and "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "`yEs`",
"`yes`", "`Yes`" and "`YES`" will be recognized as a positive answer).

**Sample 1**
Input:
```
7
1 4 3
2 5 8
9 11 20
0 0 0
20 20 20
4 12 3
15 7 8
```
Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
```
